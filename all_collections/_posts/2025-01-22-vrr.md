(WIP)

On Nvidia GPUs, G-Sync + (Nvidia Control Panel) V-Sync combined with an FPS limiter is the ideal configuration for no screen tearing. When the former two are enabled Low Latency Mode "Ultra" will act as an automatic driver-side FPS limiter, so it is the laziest effective approach. On AMD, it appears driver-side limiters can add noticeable[^1] latency, at least in some games.

- NVCP V-Sync + G-Sync + in-game FPS limiter at least 3 below max refresh rate

- At least in Valorant, external (Radeon Software, RTSS) framerate limiter adds far more input lag than in-game compared to behavior on GeForce
